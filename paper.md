#Introduction
We were on Ascension Island and there were a few wild donkeys who liked to hang around near the hotel.

Donkeys like to eat bananas (Chiquito et al., 1955).

The guy from the hotel got us some bananas (Hotel et al, 2017)

We had an idea to feed the bananas to the donkeys

#Simulations
We developed an elaborate FORTRAN model to simulate the insertion of bananas into a generic mammalian mouth

#Methodology
We compared out video evidence of Keith giving a banana to a donkey with our model simulations.
The model is detailed in FromReading et al (2017).
