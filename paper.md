# Introduction
We were on Ascension Island and there were a few wild donkeys who liked to hang around near the hotel.

Donkeys like to eat bananas (Chiquito et al., 1955).

The guy from the hotel got us some bananas (Hotel et al, 2017).

We had an idea to feed the bananas to the donkeys

# Simulations
We developed an elaborate FORTRAN model to simulate the insertion of bananas into a generic mammalian mouth

# Methodology
We compared out video evidence of Keith giving a banana to a donkey with our model simulations.
The model is detailed in FromReading et al (2017).

# Results
The video showed clear evidence of both humans and donkeys eating bananas, in good agreement with the model simulations.
The video also showed transfer of bananas from a human mouth to a donkey mouth. We suggest further model development.

# Figures

# Conclusions
Donkeys and humans both like bananas. Donkeys will also eat bananas when transferred directly from a human's mouth.

# Discussion
It would be interesting to investigate whether these results can be replicated in different species
